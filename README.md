## Introduction

MediaOutput and MediaPlayer implementation in Unreal Engine based on Spout.

Spout is a video frame sharing system for Microsoft Windows, It's Lossless and Zero-Latency but only for Local Machine.

You can use SpoutMediaOutput to send UE Viewport or Texture to OBS or SpoutCam ( or any Spout Receiver).

You can use SpoutMediaPlayer to receive/play any Spout Source.

It's all based on UE Builtin features, MediaCapture framework and MediaPlayer framework.


Only tested on DirectX12.
